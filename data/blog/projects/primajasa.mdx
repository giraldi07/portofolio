## The Risets

- See the project full on figma [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/QTDWzW2nJgyV6tcGtDK63M/HASIL-RISET?type=design&node-id=24%3A183&mode=design&t=gcVCIFSkc0Ixt379-1)

## Home Page:

### The Problems:

- The background on the home page lacks attractiveness and feels rigid.
- Inconsistency in the shape and positioning of icons for displayed features.
- Automatic advertisements disrupt the user experience.
- Lack of responsiveness when tapping on features or menus to open new pages.
- Booking tickets requires additional effort.

### Solutions:

- Redesign the UI background according to UI principles to enhance user experience.
- Align each menu icon in the application for consistency.
- Change video ads to images.
- Rearrange ad layouts.
- Remove or replace ads with more relevant content.
- Improve responsiveness for each menu.
- Rearrange the user flow for booking tickets.

## Facilities Page:

### The Problems:

- Different first impressions of icons lead users to believe they are related to "Favorites" or "Ratings" rather than relevant information.
- Poorly organized layout and white space distribution.

### Solutions:

- Replace old icons with more relevant ones according to the purpose and information conveyed.
- Rearrange the layout of each content or information.

## About Page:

### The Problems:

- Similar issues with icons as on the facilities page, leading users to believe they are irrelevant to the displayed information.
- The header's background shape is rigid.
- Typography lacks hierarchy due to inconsistent font sizes and types.
- Irregular white space distribution.

### Solutions:

- Replace old icons with more relevant ones according to the purpose and information conveyed.
- Rearrange the UI hierarchy in the application.
