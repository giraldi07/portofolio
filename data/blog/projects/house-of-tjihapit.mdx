In December 2023, I was tasked with creating a Landing Page for the **House of Tjihapit Coffee Shop** in **Bandung**. The process involved going through a **briefing stage**, **wireframing**, implementing the design onto the wireframe using **Figma**, and finally, hosting it for free using **Framer**.
