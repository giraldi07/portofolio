## Creation of an E-commerce Website.

In 2023, I created this. Cekhas is an e-commerce website that sells various women's shoes, including heels, sandals, and mules. The website's user interface is modern and user-friendly, with clear product photos and detailed descriptions. Customers can filter products by type, material, and size. The website also offers a secure payment system, so customers can shop with confidence.

## Challenges & Solutions

> **Challenges:**

- Working solo without IT support from the client or the company, resulting in trial and error being solely handled by myself from start to finish.
- Facing frequent difficulties due to encountering errors beyond my experience and the limitations of freely available information, as many valuable and relevant Shopify tutorials often require payment.
- Often conflicting with several divisions of the client company, particularly Graphic Design and Marketing, especially regarding copywriting, resulting in delays in content creation. This led to me creating website content such as visuals, images, videos, and written materials on my own. Many website development tasks were hindered by these divisions, affecting my progress.
- Encountering obstacles with the payment method used, Midtrans, as the client company failed to fulfill the third-party Midtrans's documentation requirements for licensing.

> **Solutions:**

- To address the lack of IT support and the need for extensive trial and error, I adopted a proactive approach to research and problem-solving, leveraging online resources, documentation, and forums to overcome challenges independently.
- Overcoming the limitations of freely available information, I invested in premium Shopify tutorials and sought guidance from paid courses and experts in the field to gain deeper insights and knowledge.
- To mitigate conflicts with the Graphic Design and Marketing divisions, I implemented clear communication channels and established collaborative workflows, ensuring alignment on content creation timelines and objectives.
- To circumvent delays in content creation, particularly in visuals, videos, and written materials, I honed my skills in multimedia production and copywriting, allowing me to create compelling and high-quality content for the website autonomously.
- To address obstacles with the Midtrans payment method, I liaised closely with the client company and third-party Midtrans to facilitate the necessary documentation process, ensuring compliance with licensing requirements and smooth integration of the payment gateway.
